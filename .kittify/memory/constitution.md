## Purpose

This constitution captures the technical standards and governance rules for the Online Book Library System. All features and pull requests should align with these principles.

## Technical Standards

### Languages and Frameworks

- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js with clear separation of concerns
- **Frontend:** Vue.js 3 with Composition API and Pinia
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Code Style:** ESLint + Prettier
- **Security:** JWT authentication, input validation, bcrypt passwords

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing:** Jest for backend and frontend unit tests
- **Fast Testing:** Vitest for optimized test runs
- **End-to-End Testing:** Playwright for user workflow validation
- **Coverage Requirement:** 80% code coverage minimum across all layers
- **Coverage Targets:** Critical paths (authentication, data access, API endpoints) require 90%+ coverage

### Performance and Scale

N/A - Performance is not a primary concern for the current phase.

### Deployment and Constraints

N/A - No specific deployment constraints at this time. The system is designed to be deployable on any standard Node.js-compatible infrastructure.

## Governance

### Compliance Validation

Code reviewers validate compliance with this constitution during pull request review. Constitution violations (e.g., missing tests, unvalidated inputs, improper authentication handling) should be flagged and addressed before merge.
